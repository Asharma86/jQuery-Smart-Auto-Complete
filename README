 Smart Auto Complete plugin 

 $(target).smartAutoComplete({options})

options:
minCharLength: (integer) minimum characters user have to type before invoking the autocomplete (default: 2)
maxResults: (integer) maximum number of results to return (default: -1 (unlimited))
delay: (integer) delay before autocomplete starts (default: 10ms)
typeAhead: (boolean) fill the field with the best matching result, as in google instant search (default: false)
           and fires the select event.
disabled: (boolean) whether autocomplete disabled on the field (default: false)
source:  (array/function) you can supply an array or callback function that would return an array for the source
         this is optional if you prefer to have your own filter method 
         eg: ["Apple", "Banana", "Mango"] or [["Apple", 1], ["Banana", 2], ["Mango", 3]]
         or [["Apple", 1, {picture: 'apple.jpg'}], ["Banana", 2, {picture: 'banana.jpg'}], ["Mango", 3, {picture: 'mango.jpg'}]]
filter: (function) define a function on that would return matching items to the query (use this if you want to override the default filtering algorithm)
        expects to return an array 
        arguments: query, list
resultFormatter: (function) the function you supply here will be called to format the output of the individual result.
                 expects to return a string
                 arguments: result 
appendTo: (selector) to which elements the result should be appended.
forceSelect: (boolean) always fills the field with best matching result, without leaving custom input (similar to a select field) (default false)

events:
select: fires when user selects an item from the result list
enable: fires when autocomplete is disabled
disable: fires when autocomplete is enabled
resultsReady: fires when filtered results are appended to the view 
noMatch: fires when filter returns an empty array to append to the view
